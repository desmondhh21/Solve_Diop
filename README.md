Prompt: Create an executable python code that can solve the Diophantine equation. (x^3)+(y^3)+(z^3) = k which value is all numbers from 0-100. First explain the question at hand and what is happening, the logic, and how to go about solving. 


### Understanding the Question

The problem involves solving a specific type of **Diophantine equation**, which is an equation that seeks integer solutions. The equation given is:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k
\]

where \(k\) is an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive, and \(x, y, z\) are integers (positive, negative, or zero).

The goal is to find all possible combinations of integers \(x, y, z\) that satisfy this equation for each value of \(k\) in the range [0, 100].

### Challenges

- **Cubic growth:** Cubes grow very quickly, so brute-forcing all possible \(x, y, z\) can be computationally expensive.
- **Negative numbers:** The solution space involves both positive and negative integers.
- **Existence of solutions:** Not all values of \(k\) have solutions (e.g., some values are conjectured to have no solutions or remain unsolved).

### Approach

1. **Range of Search:** Limit the range of \(x, y, z\) to a reasonable bound (e.g., \([-100, 100]\)), as cubes of large numbers will exceed our target range.
2. **Optimization:** 
    - Pre-calculate cubes to avoid redundant calculations.
    - Use symmetry properties of cubes (e.g., \(x^3 = (-x)^3\)) to reduce computation.
3. **Iterate Over \(k\):** For each \(k\), test combinations of \(x, y, z\) to find solutions.
4. **Filtering:** Stop testing combinations early when it's clear they can't satisfy \(k\).

### Implementation

Below is the Python code:

```python
def solve_diophantine():
    # Define the range of k and the search space for x, y, z
    k_range = range(0, 101)  # k values from 0 to 100
    search_space = range(-100, 101)  # x, y, z values between -100 and 100
    
    # Precompute cubes for efficiency
    cubes = {i: i**3 for i in search_space}
    
    # Dictionary to store results
    solutions = {}
    
    # Iterate over all values of k
    for k in k_range:
        found = False
        # Check all combinations of x, y, z
        for x in search_space:
            for y in search_space:
                # Calculate z^3 based on the equation
                z_cubed = k - cubes[x] - cubes[y]
                if z_cubed in cubes.values():  # Check if z_cubed is a valid cube
                    z = next(key for key, value in cubes.items() if value == z_cubed)
                    solutions[k] = (x, y, z)
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            solutions[k] = None  # No solution found for this k
    
    return solutions

# Solve the equation and print results
if __name__ == "__main__":
    results = solve_diophantine()
    for k, solution in results.items():
        if solution:
            print(f"k={k}: x={solution[0]}, y={solution[1]}, z={solution[2]}")
        else:
            print(f"k={k}: No solution")
```

### Explanation of Code Logic

1. **Precomputing Cubes:**
   - A dictionary `cubes` stores integers and their cubes to speed up cube lookups.

2. **Iterating Over \(k\):**
   - For each \(k\), iterate through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Finding \(z\):**
   - Compute the required \(z^3\) using the equation \(z^3 = k - x^3 - y^3\).
   - Check if \(z^3\) is in the precomputed cube dictionary. If it is, retrieve the corresponding \(z\) value.

4. **Early Termination:**
   - Stop searching once a solution for a given \(k\) is found to save computation time.

5. **Output Results:**
   - Print solutions for each \(k\), or indicate when no solution exists.

### Expected Output

The program will output solutions for all \(k\) in the range [0, 100]. For some \(k\), it might indicate "No solution" if no integers \(x, y, z\) satisfy the equation.
